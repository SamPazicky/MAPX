# What is MAPX?

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

MAP-X (Meltome-assisted profiling of protein complexes) is a method for global profiling of protein complexes and protein-protein interactions
from TPP (thermal proteome profiling) data. The R package guides the user from measured protein abundances through reconstruction of melting curves,
training of machine learning models and using them to predict protein-protein interactions and to mapping of global maps and local networks to
visualize predicted protein interactions and protein complexes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MAPX from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SamPazicky/MAPX")
```
